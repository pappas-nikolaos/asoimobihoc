    <div style="text-align: justify;">
        <p>Age and Semantics of Information are of fundamental importance to next-generation communication systems. 
            Age of Information (AoI) is an end-to-end metric that can capture one semantic property known as timeliness or 
            freshness of information, which is important for information-update and data analytics applications (e.g., crowdsourcing, 
            financial trading, social networks, and online learning), as well as networked monitoring and control systems 
            (e.g., sensor networks, airplane/vehicular control, robotics networks, Internet of Things, and Cyber-Physical Systems). 
            Semantics of Information (SoI) captures properties of information such as relevance and importance that relate to the “goal” 
            and “purpose” of information, which is also meant to improve the performance of systems that utilize the information. 
            Recent research advances on the Age of Information suggest that many well-known design principles (e.g., for providing high 
            throughput and low delay) that lead to the success of traditional data networks are inappropriate and need to be re-examined 
            for enhancing information freshness in the rapidly emerging real-time applications. In the meantime, the paradigm shift to 
            Semantics of Information toward 6G communications systems is expected to create systems that generate, process, and transmit only 
            a small fraction of information, which will consume less energy and channel resources without sacrificing their effectiveness. 
            Therefore, the Age and Semantics of Information (ASoI) Workshop will provide a forum where researchers and technical experts 
            can share the latest research insights, present key, and emerging results on the Age and Semantics of Information, and identify 
            new challenges and opportunities.</p>
